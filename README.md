# Autoencoders
This was just a series of codes I read about in a paper and saw in a lecture.
It seemed like an intriguing alternative to PCA for dimensionality reduction considering it worked on images as well for methods such as convolution as well.
Non-linearity also seems to be a much better generalization that could be followed for dimensionality reduction.
